      </ul>
    <h2>
      Version 4.0 (September 2007)
    </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>features:
        <ul>
          <li>most models now run somewhat faster:
            <ul>
              <li>while results vary from model to model, typical speedup
              is around 1.5x
              <li>the speedup comes from an improved compiler that now
              partially compiles NetLogo code into Java byte code
              </ul>
          <li>links are now their own type of agent, alongside turtles and
          patches; this is useful for network models, geometry models, and
          much else
          <li>new Link Shapes Editor lets you control the appearance of
          links
          <li>logging allows researchers to record students' actions
          for later analysis
          <li>built in tick counter for keeping track of model time (see
          language changes, below)
          <li>new view update system:
            <ul>
              <li>there are now two view update modes, tick-based and
              continuous
              <li>continuous is the default when you start up NetLogo;
              tick-based is the default for most models in the Models
              Library; continuous update mode is useful for non-tick based
              models like Termites, but may also be useful during debugging
              <li>tick-based updates are faster for most models and avoid
              displaying intermediate state
              <li>buttons no longer have a &quot;force view update&quot;
              checkbox; most models should use <tt>tick</tt> and/or
              <tt>display</tt> instead
              </ul>
          <li>improved speed slider:
            <ul>
              <li>you can now use the slider to &quot;fast forward&quot; a
              model (by updating the view less often)
              <li>in tick-based update mode, going slower pauses between
              ticks rather than showing intermediate states
              <li>in continuous update mode, going slower shows
              intermediate states; you can even go so slow you can watch
              agents move one at a time
              </ul>
          <li>new input boxes in Interface tab permit entering text,
          numbers, colors, or NetLogo code as model parameters
          <li>arrays and hash tables are now supported via extensions (see
          Arrays &amp; Tables section of User Manual)
          <li>new profiler extension lets you measure the running times of
          your procedures
          <li>new experimental <tt>__includes</tt> keyword allows splitting
          model code into multiple source files
          <li>color variables can now contain either a NetLogo color or an
          RGB color (as a list of three numbers)
          <li>programmable slider bounds (you can now use any NetLogo
          reporter as the min, max, or increment of a slider)
          <li>exporting the world now includes all plot data, and when you
          import a world the contents of plots are restored
          <li>the sound extension can now play audio files in addition to
          MIDI sounds
          <li>notes, monitors and output areas now have editable font size
          <li>the color of text in notes is now editable, and a note's
          background may now optionally be transparent
          <li>&quot;Snap to Grid&quot; in Interface tab
          <li>added menu items (and F1 keyboard shortcut) for quickly
          accessing NetLogo Dictionary
          <li>sliders may now be vertical or horizontal
          <li>model files with unsaved changes are auto-saved to a
          temporary files directory, in case of freezes/crashes
          <li>HubNet clients are much easier to edit now (the client is no
          longer a separate model)
          <li>Mathematica-NetLogo link provides a real-time link between
          Mathematica and NetLogo, for controlling model runs and
          visualizing and analyzing results after the fact or in real time
          <li>the <tt>run</tt> and <tt>runresult</tt> primitives are now
          drastically faster when called repeatedly on the same string
          <li>internally, lists are now represented as linked lists, not
          arrays
          <li>plotting is now supported when running headless
          </ul>
      <li>language changes:
        <ul>
          <li>the <tt>ask</tt> command now always runs &quot;without
          interruption&quot;; if you need the old-style concurrent
          behavior, use <tt>ask-concurrent</tt>
          <li>turtle who numbers are now never reused until
          <tt>clear-turtles</tt> or <tt>clear-all</tt>
          <li>all numbers are now represented internally using double
          precision floating point
          <li>the <tt>+</tt> operator only adds numbers now; it doesn't
          work on strings or lists anymore; models must be changed by hand
          to use <tt>word</tt> instead for strings and <tt>sentence</tt>
          instead for numbers
          <li>
            <tt>create-turtles</tt> now makes turtles with random headings
            and colors; to get evenly spaced turtles with sequential colors
            and id numbers use <tt>create-ordered-turtles</tt>
            (<tt>cro</tt> for short)
          <li>extension primitives must now (by default) be referred to
          using the extension name, e.g. <tt>sound:drums</tt> instead of
          just <tt>drums</tt>
          <li>new <tt>uphill</tt>, <tt>uphill4</tt>, <tt>downhill</tt>, and
          <tt>downhill4</tt> commands for doing hill-climbing replace old
          reporters with same names
          <li>new tick counter primitives: <tt>tick</tt>, <tt>ticks</tt>,
          <tt>tick-advance</tt>, <tt>reset-ticks</tt>
          <li>new primitive <tt>of</tt> replaces <tt>VARIABLE-of</tt>, <tt>
            value-from</tt>, <tt>values-from</tt>
          <li>other new primitives: <tt>all?</tt>, <tt>other</tt>,
          <tt>move-to</tt>, <tt>turtle-set</tt>, <tt>patch-set</tt>,
          <tt>link-set</tt>, <tt>no-turtles</tt>, <tt>no-patches</tt>, <tt>
            no-links</tt>, <tt>tie</tt>, <tt>untie</tt>, <tt>min-n-of</tt>,
            <tt>max-n-of</tt>, <tt>with-local-randomness</tt>,
            <tt>file-flush</tt>, <tt>base-colors</tt>,
            <tt>plot-pen-exists?</tt>, <tt>import-pcolors-rgb</tt>,
            <tt>netlogo-applet?</tt>
